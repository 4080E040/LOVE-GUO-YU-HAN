# Volume（容量）
```
Within the Social Media space for example, Volume refers to the amount of data generated through websites,
portals and online applications. Especially for B2C companies, Volume encompasses the available data that are
out there and need to be assessed for relevance. Consider the following -Facebook has 2 billion users,
Youtube 1 billion users,Twitter 350 million users and Instagram 700 million users.
Every day, these users contribute to billions of images,
posts, videos,tweets etc. You can now imagine the insanely large amount -or Volume- of data
that is generated every minute and every hour.  
```
# Velocity（速度）
```
With Velocity we refer to the speed with which data are being generated.
Staying with our social media example,
every day 900 million photos are uploaded on Facebook,
500 million tweets are posted on Twitter, 0.4 million hours of
video are uploaded on Youtube and 3.5 billion searches are performed in Google.
This is like a nuclear data explosion. Big Data helps the company to hold this explosion,
accept the incoming flow of data and at the same time process it fast so that it does not create bottlenecks.
```
# Variety（多樣性）
```
Variety in Big Data refers to all the structured and unstructured data that has the possibility
of getting generated either by humans or by machines. The most commonly added data are structured -texts,
tweets, pictures & videos. However, unstructured data like emails, voicemails,
hand-written text, ECG reading, audio recordings etc, are also important elements under Variety.
Variety is all about the ability to classify the incoming data into various categories.
```
# Veracity（真實性）
```
Veracity has everything to do with accuracy which from a decision and intelligence viewpoint becomes
certainty and the degree in which we can trust upon the data to do what we need/want to do.
```
# Value（價值）
```
As said we add value to that as it’s about the goal, the outcome, the prioritization and the overall 
value and relevance created in Big Data applications, whereby the value lies in the eye of the beholder 
and the stakeholder and never or rarely in the volume dimension. Welcome to Big Data in Action.
